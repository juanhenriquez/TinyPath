### The Dashboard:

The `/dashboard` page is where can see the list of links generated by the user.

#### Layout Modes:

There are 2 layout modes available: Table and Group.

- **Table layout**: In the Table layout you can see all the links created by the user in paginated table. The user is allowed to sort by created date or clicks count.

- **Group layout**: In the Group layout, links are grouped by date in a nice looking UI with Infinite Loading.
  In this layout mode there is a new "Sort" button available at the top where you can sort by Date AND Clicks count at the same time.

Boths layouts make use of the `GET /api/links` endpoint which returns a paginated set of results
based on some query params like `take`, `page`, etc.

For Demostration purposes, the table layout uses a regular react-query's `useQuery` to fetch the paginated set of data,
while the group layout uses `useInfiniteQuery` to demostrate the capabilities of the 2 methods of showing paginated sets of data.

#### Link Creation:

![dashboard link creation](assets/dashboard-create-button.png)


From the dashboard, users are going to havea "Create Link" button available at the top of the page.
This button shows a custom dialog component with the form to create the link.

Users can specify an optional name in case they want to give an easy-to-remember name to their links.

Once the user submits the form, we update the UI inmmediatly by invalidatiing the queries in charge of fetching the
list of links.

### Link Details page:

![link details page](assets/details-page.png)


Users can go to `/links/[linkId]` page and see the details of each link they created.

They can also update their link's original, name or both at the same time. Under the hood this sends a `PUT` requests to `/api/links/[linkId]` to update the link.

Is worth mentioning that the click count only resets if the users modifies the original link. If the user only updates the name of the link, the click count will remain the same.
